# Remember, abstractions generalize and simplify our code by reducing complexity.
# One way oop reduces complexity is by providing encapsulation.
# One goal of encapsulation is to hide details. I don't care how append works in a list, all I want to know is that I can use it.
# Another one is grouping details into a cohesive model, into a class
